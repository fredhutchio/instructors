# Information for fredhutch.io instructors

## Preparing to teach

- Our teaching methods generally follow those described by [The Carpentries' Instructor Training materials](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/). In particular, we use live coding demos (learners following along with instructors) with challenge exercises interspersed throughout the material (preferably every 20-30 minutes, depending on the material).
- If you have any suggestions or corrections, please feel free to submit a pull request to the lesson in question!

## During class

- Each class should have a course website available in something like [HackMD](https://hackmd.io) to share links and code snippets with learners. Instructors should be able to edit these, although we don't recommend having learners attempt to edit these pages. If the content of the page is disrupted, all material is available in `hackmdio.txt` in the class repository.
- There are three laptops available to learners to borrow during class sessions. These computers are kept in a locked cabinet in the Coop Lab and should not leave the room. The two Macs have the login and password listed on a sticky note attached to the machine; the Windows laptop can be accessed via HutchnetID.
- Please have learners sign in to each class session, preferably using the Google Form available on each course's HackMD.
- Begin each class session with a quick review of the previous week's learning objectives (if applicable), as well as an overview of objectives for the current class session. At the end of each session, repeat the current session's learning objectives and relate to the next week's materials. This is especially useful in multi-week courses to reiterate the overall learning objectives for the course.
- Administering challenges: this section will vary based on the course content and interface.
- Regroup following challenge exercises and allow the class to suggest a variety of solutions to answer the problem.
- Timing and pacing can be adjusted with challenge exercises. You can add or remove challenges from a given class, or give more or less time as pacing allows. There are extra challenges in `exercises/`
- For classes longer than 1.5 hours, it is useful to include a ~10 minute break halfway through the class session. It works well to administer a challenge exercise and then take a break, so folks can work on the exercise and/or move around as necessary. Address the challenge after the break before moving on to the next section.

## Accomodating learner absences

Our course listings let learners know they are expected to attend most (e.g., three of four) sessions. Periodically, additional absences may be required; here's what you should offer:
- At the very least, a link to the fredhutch.io course material for the materials they will miss. In the case of lessons that are modified from other sources like The Carpentries, you can also offer the links to webpages for their better-formatted instructions.
- You can meet one-on-one with learners at your discretion (but please don't feel obligated to do this). Usually a half hour is sufficient to highlight the main themes and to link the missed material together with other course content. This could be directly prior to the next class session, although that's sometimes not enough time for them to review the material.
- Learners can attend fredhutch.io office hours (Tuesday mornings from nine to noon in the Coop Lab) and review the material with one of our team members. 

## After teaching

- Learners have the opportunity to submit feedback on the course via Hutch Learning. Although our response rate for the surveys remain low, we'll synthesize and pass along any comments to you as we're able.
